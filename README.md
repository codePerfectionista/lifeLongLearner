# Lifelong Learner
I'm a lifelong learner with an insatiable curiosity for technology. I thrive on solving problems and get incredibly excited about discovering new solutions and innovations. My enthusiasm is backed by certifications that reflect my commitment to continually expanding my knowledge and skills.

Currently, my goal is to obtain the Microsoft Certified: **Azure Developer Associate certification**. This will enable me to build end-to-end solutions in Microsoft Azure, including creating Azure Functions, managing web apps, and developing solutions utilizing Azure storage, among other skills.
